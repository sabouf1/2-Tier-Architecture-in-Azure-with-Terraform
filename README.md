# Azure 2-Tier Architecture with Terraform

This Terraform project automates the deployment of a 2-Tier architecture in Microsoft Azure. It consists of an application tier with a Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS) serving a web application and a database tier using Azure Database for PostgreSQL. The infrastructure also includes essential networking components like Virtual Network, Subnet, Load Balancer, and DNS Zone.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:

- **Terraform**: You need to have Terraform installed on your local machine.

   ```bash
   # Install Terraform (Linux)
   $ curl -fsSL https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
   $ echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list > /dev/null
   $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install terraform
   ```

- **Azure CLI**: Authenticate with Azure using the Azure CLI.

   ```bash
   # Authenticate with Azure CLI
   $ az login
   ```

## Configuration

### `variables.tf`

The `variables.tf` file contains variables used in the Terraform configuration. You can customize these variables to match your requirements.

```bash
# Open variables.tf for editing
$ nano variables.tf
```

### `main.tf`

The `main.tf` file holds the main Terraform configuration. This is where you define the Azure resources, networking, and configurations.

```bash
# Open main.tf for editing
$ nano main.tf
```

## Usage

Follow these steps to create and provision Azure resources:

### Initialize Terraform

Initialize Terraform in the project directory:

```bash
$ terraform init
```

### Review Terraform Plan

Generate and review the execution plan to understand what Terraform will create:

```bash
$ terraform plan
```

### Apply the Configuration

Apply the Terraform configuration to create Azure resources:

```bash
$ terraform apply
```

## Outputs

Terraform will provide outputs after provisioning. For example, you can retrieve the public IP address of the Load Balancer:

```bash
$ terraform output load_balancer_public_ip
```

## Cleanup

To destroy Azure resources created by Terraform, use:

```bash
$ terraform destroy
```
