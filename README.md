# Azure 2-Tier Architecture with Terraform

This Terraform project deploys a 2-Tier architecture in Azure, consisting of an application tier with a Virtual Machine Scale Set and a database tier with Azure Database for PostgreSQL. The infrastructure includes networking components such as Virtual Network, Subnet, Load Balancer, and DNS Zone.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites set up:

```bash
# Install Terraform
$ curl -fsSL https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
$ echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list > /dev/null
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install terraform

# Authenticate with Azure (using Azure CLI)
$ az login
```

## Configuration

### `variables.tf`

Edit the `variables.tf` file to customize the variables used in the Terraform configuration according to your requirements.

```bash
$ nano variables.tf
```

### `main.tf`

The `main.tf` file contains the Terraform configuration for provisioning Azure resources. Customize the variables and review the file as needed.

```bash
$ nano main.tf
```

## Usage

### Initialize Terraform

Initialize Terraform in the project directory:

```bash
$ terraform init
```

### Review the Terraform Plan

Review the execution plan to understand what Terraform will create:

```bash
$ terraform plan
```

### Apply the Configuration

Apply the Terraform configuration to create Azure resources:

```bash
$ terraform apply
```

## Outputs

After provisioning, Terraform will provide outputs. For example, to get the public IP address of the Load Balancer:

```bash
$ terraform output load_balancer_public_ip
```

## Cleanup

To destroy Azure resources created by Terraform, use:

```bash
$ terraform destroy
```
